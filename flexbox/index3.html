        <h1>Align-self: Allows you to override align-items on individual flex items</h1>
        <p>This allows us to move the 3rd box to the flex-start or end if we'd like</p>

        <h1>Flex:Defines how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the available space in a container. Shorthand for grow,shrink and basis</h1>
        <h1>When we have extra space how should we divide amongst everyone on the same line</h1>
        <h1>flex-basis:specifies the ideal size of a flex item BEFORE it's placed into a flex container on the main axis. So that'd be width in a row and height on a column. Can be pixels or percent. Will shrink if there's no wrap. </h1>
        <p>The basis is at 50% but there's no wrapping so they shrink to 25% for each box</p>
        <section class="container-2">
            <section class="basis-box box1">1</section>
            <section class="basis-box box2">2</section>
            <section class="basis-box box3">3</section>
            <section class="basis-box box4">4</section>
        </section>
        <p>The basis is at 50% and there's wrapping so the bottom 2 will wrap to the next line</p>
        <section class="container-3">
            <section class="basis-box box1">1</section>
            <section class="basis-box box2">2</section>

            <section class="basis-box box4">4</section>
        </section>
        <p>This is what makes basis different from width we have basis set to 50 so each box takes 50% of the space vertically</p>
